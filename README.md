Here’s a **simple and clear project plan** for the "Pixel Animal Medicine" app based on your requirements:

---

### **Project Plan for "Pixel Animal Medicine" App**

### **Main Tasks**
---

#### **1. Project Setup**
   - **Objective**: Set up the basic project structure.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Create a folder for the project.
     - Set up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

---

#### **2. HTML Development**
   - **Objective**: Create the structure of the app.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Write the base HTML structure (`index.html`).
     - Add a title (`<h1>`) for the app.
     - Include a "Draw Card" button (`<button>`).
     - Add placeholders for:
       - Animal image (`<div id="animal-image">`).
       - Medicine summary (`<div id="medicine-summary">`).
     - Link the CSS file and Google Fonts.

---

#### **3. CSS Styling**
   - **Objective**: Style the app to match the design requirements.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Set the background color to grey.
     - Use the "Press Start 2P" pixel font for all text.
     - Center-align all content.
     - Style the button to look clickable and fit the pixel theme.

---

#### **4. JavaScript Development**
   - **Objective**: Implement the "Draw Card" functionality.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Create an array of animal objects with attributes:
       - `name`: Animal name.
       - `image`: URL or path to the animal image.
       - `medicine`: Summary of the animal’s medicine attributes.
     - Write a function to handle the "Draw Card" button click:
       - Randomly select an animal from the array.
       - Update the DOM to display the animal’s image and medicine summary.
     - Ensure the app is responsive to button clicks.

---

#### **5. Testing**
   - **Objective**: Verify the app works as expected.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Test the "Draw Card" button to ensure it generates a random animal and displays the correct image and summary.
     - Check the design on different screen sizes.
     - Ensure the app complies with the constraints (no external libraries, only HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

---

#### **6. Deployment (Optional)**
   - **Objective**: Make the app accessible online.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Host the app on a free platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).

---

### **Technical Considerations**
---

#### **HTML**
   - Use semantic elements (`<div>`, `<button>`, `<h1>`, etc.).
   - Ensure proper linking of CSS and JavaScript files.
   - Include the Google Fonts link in the `<head>`.

#### **CSS**
   - Use the `font-family: 'Press Start 2P', cursive;` for the pixel font.
   - Set `background-color: grey;` for the body.
   - Center-align content using `text-align: center;` and appropriate margins/padding.

#### **JavaScript**
   - Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries).
   - Store animal data in an array of objects.
   - Use `Math.random()` to randomly select an animal.
   - Dynamically update the DOM using `document.getElementById()` and `innerHTML` or `innerText`.

#### **Assets**
   - Use pixelated images for the animals to match the theme.
   - Ensure image paths or URLs are correct and accessible.

### **Timeline**

| Project Setup      | 1 hour         |

| CSS Styling        | 2 hours        |
| JavaScript Development | 3 hours    |

---

### **Resources Needed**
- Pixel animal images (e.g., `cat.png`, `dog.png`, `rabbit.png`).
- Google Fonts link for "Press Start 2P".
- Text editor/IDE (e.g., VS Code).
- Web browser for testing.
